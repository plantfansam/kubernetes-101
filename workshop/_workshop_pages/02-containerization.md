title: "Containerization"
---

As noted in the [introduction]({{ site.baseurl }}/01-introduction), HyperScale Pizza is moving their application onto Kubernetes, which means that we first need to **containerize** our application. Docker is a popular [containerization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Container_(virtualization)) technology, and Docker containers are typically what Kubernetes deploys. In this section, we'll prepare our app for deployment on Kubernetes by containerizing our webapp service and our topping suggestion service.

## Containerizing our Services

### What's a container

While a full discussion of containerization is beyond the scope of this workshop, it is helpful to have an understanding of what containerization _is_. The basic idea is this: for any application, you can specify what other software that application needs to run successfully; once you do that, you can package up your application along with those dependencies in a container **image**. If you express these dependencies systematically (e.g. in a `Dockerfile`), you can **build** a container image that contains your application and its underlying dependencies. This baked image can be run anywhere that has a **container runtime**. In practical terms, this means that if you create a Docker image for your application, you can then run that Docker image anywhere that has Docker installed (there are some exceptions to this, but they're just that — exceptions). This is really neat because it allows you to easily co-locate multiple applications on the same server and reduce the burden associated with configuring servers. 

### Writing the webapp-service Dockerfile

With that very fast overview of containerization out of the way, let's get to the nitty gritty of HyperScale Pizza's Kubernetes voyage. As discussed above, we need to to leverage the power of Docker images to put the app on Kubernetes. The first step is create a [**Dockerfile**](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) that defines the application and its dependencies:

We'll start with the webapp service — let's create a file called `Dockerfile` in the `webapp-service` directory: 

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.7.2-stretch

ADD requirements.txt /app/requirements.txt
WORKDIR /app
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
ADD . /app

ENV FLASK_APP=app.py
CMD ["flask", "run", "-p", "1234", "-h", "0.0.0.0"]
```

The Docker image created by this Dockerfile has everything the app needs to run. The final line contains the default command, which is run whenever you create a Docker container based on this Docker image. You'll notice that we are serving the application on port `1234` and binding to the host `0.0.0.0`.

### Building the webapp service Docker image

Writing a Dockerfile doesn't give you a Docker image. To get a Docker image from a Dockerfile, you must **build** (some call it "baking") a Docker image using the [docker build](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/) command (you could also use a tool like [`buildah`](https://buildah.io/), but we won't).

To build the image, navigate to the `webapp-service` directory and run `docker build -t yourname/hs-pizza-webapp-service:latest .`. This creates your Docker image.

The `-t` flag is there to **tag** our Docker image so we can easily refer to it in the future — I'd recommend changing it to have your name as a prefix. There is nothing special about the `:latest` tag — it's just a convention that some people use.

### Running the webapp service Docker image

Now that we have the Docker image, let's put it to use by running it. When you run a Docker image, you create a **container**, which is a running process (I like to think of Docker containers as Docker images in italics).

From anywhere on your machine, run `docker run -p 9999:1234 yourname/hs-pizza-webapp-service:latest` (the `-p` flag says to forward traffic from port `9999` on our host machine to port `1234` inside the Docker container). Now, visit `localhost:9999`. You should see a slightly broken HyperScale Pizza homepage. The topping-combo-suggester service is not available!

### Killing the webapp service Docker container

To kill your running Docker container, we'll use the `docker ps` and `docker kill` commands. Open up a new tab in your terminal and run `docker ps` — you should see your running container. Run `docker kill asdfghjkl`, where `asdfghjl` is the `CONTAINER ID` in the leftmost column of the `docker ps` output.

### Pushing the Docker image to a registry

Once we're confident that our Docker image works, we can push it to a Docker registry, so it's easily downloadable (this is useful for that whole you can run the same Docker image everywhere thing). A Docker registry lets you (and others that are granted access) retrieve baked Docker images so they can be run on different machines (which is the whole point!). We'll be using DockerHub, which offers both public and private Docker image repositories — for ease of retrieval, we'll use public ones, but production applications should use private image repositories.

To push our image, we need to [register for a DockerHub account](https://hub.docker.com/signup), and note your Docker ID. Once registered, run `docker login` to authenticate against DockerHub.

Next, run `docker images` and look for the image we just baked (you might want to run `docker images | grep webapp-service`). When you find it, we'll re-tag our image if necessary — the tag should be in the format `yourDockerID/hs-pizza-webapp-service:latest`. You can re-tag by noting the `IMAGE ID` and running `docker tag IMAGE_ID yourDockerID/hs-pizza-webapp-service:latest`.

Once you have tagged the image, just run `docker push yourDockerID/hs-pizza-webapp-service:latest`. The argument to the `docker push` command is just the name of the tag on your host.

## Exercise: creating, running, and pushing the topping suggestion service image

We've already created and pushed the Docker image for the webapp service, so for this exercise, use the following code to create a Docker image for the topping suggestion service, which is in the `topping-suggestion-service` directory. We'll use the tag `yourname/hs-pizza-topping-suggestion-service:latest`.

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.7.2-stretch

ADD requirements.txt /app/requirements.txt
WORKDIR /app
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
ADD . /app

ENV FLASK_APP=app.py

# Notice that the Flask app is configured to serve on port `5678`.
CMD ["flask", "run", "-p", "5678", "-h", "0.0.0.0"]
```

Once you have created your Docker image, run a container based on that image — making sure to forward local traffic to the port Flask is serving on — and hit the `/topping_combo` endpoint to verify it's working. 

Finally, push the image to DockerHub at `yourDockerID/hs-pizza-topping-suggestion-service:latest`.
