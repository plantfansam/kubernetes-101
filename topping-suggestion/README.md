# README

This directory contains the topping suggestion service. The topping suggestion service is not hit directly by usersÂ - the webapp service hits the `/topping_combo` endpoint, which returns JSON that contains a delectable combination of pizza toppings (e.g. basil, thyme, and quail).

## Running the application 

First, make sure you have `pip` by running `which pip` (`pip` is a python package manager, and this application uses python packages). The repo uses python 3.

To check your version of python run `pip -V`. 

If you have other python apps on your computer using 2.* python, you might see that pip is using python 2.*. If this is the case, you will need to use `pip3` instead of `pip` for the next step.

Next, from this directory install requirements by running:  
 
 `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
  
  **OR**  
  
  `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`  

Finally, run `flask run -p 5678 -h 0.0.0.0` from this directory to run the application on port `5678`.
